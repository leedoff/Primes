1. Description

	Primes is a program which can test primality (for not so large 
	numbers) and find primes on an interval.
	Again, the purpose of this was more to train myself with GUIs
	rather than to make a purposeful program, but if you can use it,
	that's even better.
	
2. How to use
	
	After choosing the correct version (x86 or x64), you can just
	double click on the .exe file to start the program. 
	Simple as that.

	2.1 Troubleshooting
		
		- Unresponsiveness : Working with big numbers the 
		program will seem unresponsive as the calculations can be 
		somewhat hard on the CPU. Just wait until it finishes. 
		
		- Crash after hitting "Run" : the program likely tries to 
		use too much memory or has some other optimization issue.
		Will be fixed inthe future.
	
3. How it works
	
	Primality Test: Iterates over all natural numbers "n" below the 
	number that it is supposed to test "p", basically does 
	if ( p % n == 0 ) then ( p is not prime )
	
4. License information

	Use it for whatever you want, as long as it's not commercial.
	
5. Disclaimer
	
	In case the program tries to establish any unwanted connections 
	or behaves weirdly, please feel free to contact me (see "6. 
	Contact") and stop using it, as you may have run into a damaged 
	/ infected version.
	If you download the program Primes.exe from anywhere 
	else than github.com/leedoff, it is your own responsibility to 
	make sure that it is safe. If you're not sure about where you 
	got the .exe from, delete it and download it again, this time 
	from the official repository.
